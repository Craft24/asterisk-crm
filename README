====================================================================================

asterCRM is a AJAX based 'Call Center' system. 

First, Asterisk Events are captured as the occur via a perl script called eventsdaemon and
logged to a MySQl database table.
Since Asterisk is sending these events as they occur (and not being polled for these events),
this leads to a more efficient Asterisk interface.

eventsdaemon.pl is a perl script which connects to AMI (the Asterisk Manager
Interface) via a stock, listens for any events or messages coming from
the AMI, time stamps each event and logs them to a MySQL database table.

eventsdaemon can be run on any machine and not confined running in your Asterisk server,
More information on the function of eventsdaemon can be found in its source comments.

WEB PHP scripts will analyze Asterisk Events in database, and finish call center jobs, 
such as pop-up, click to dial, call queue ... 

asterCRM scripts require a running WEB and MySQL server (in which stored asterisk events).
All of these processes can run on the same server, 
however, multiple servers enhance performance.

2. asterCRM Installation: (assuming your WEB root is /var/www/html)

1) Download and unzip the source

	cd /var/www/html
	unzip astercrm-X.X-XXXX.zip

	Note: this creates the /var/www/html/astercrm directory which contains the
	PHP scripts and several sub-directories. 

	/var/www/html/astercrm						main directory and PHP scripts  
	/var/www/html/astercrm/astercrm.conf.php	astercrm configration file
	/var/www/html/astercrm/eventsdaemon 		eventsdaemon file
	/var/www/html/astercrm/includes 			files needed in php scripts
	/var/www/html/astercrm/includes/language 	asterCRM language files
	/var/www/html/astercrm/images				image files used via the PHP scripts
	/var/www/html/astercrm/css					style files used via the PHP scripts
	/var/www/html/astercrm/js					auto-complete java scripts
	/var/www/html/astercrm/upload				
	/var/www/html/astercrm/cdr					Asterisk-stat				
	/var/www/html/astercrm/sql					sql to create astercrm database 

	It is highly advised that the whole eventsdaemon directory be moved to a more secure
	location like /opt and out of the WEB root directory (in step 2)

2) Create the directories and move eventsdaemon scripts:

	mkdir /opt/asterisk
	mkdir /opt/asterisk/scripts
	mkdir /opt/asterisk/scripts/events
	mv /var/www/html/astercrm/eventsdaemon/* /opt/asterisk/scripts/events
	chmod +x /opt/asterisk/scripts/events/eventsdaemon.pl

3) Create the MySQL database and table, asterCRM need mysql 4.1 or above

	mysqladmin create asterisk
	mysql </var/www/html/astercrm/sql/astercrm.sql -uyourmysqluser -pyourmysqlpasswd

	Note: the astercrm.sql file will create tables in database named "asterisk"
		use your configration to replace "yourmysqluser" and "yourmysqlpasswd"
	
4) Update /etc/asterisk/manager.conf to enable Manager connections
	Note: asterisk and astercrm could be on different server
 
	Add something like this to the manager.conf file:

	[general]
	enabled = yes
	port = 5038
	bindaddr = 0.0.0.0
	;displayconnects = yes

	;the following line could be changed by your selft
	[eventmanager]
	secret = asterisksecret
	read = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user
	write = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user

5) modify astercrm.conf.php and eventsdaemon.pl to fit your configration
	including database setting and AMI setting

6) Start Asterisk and  eventsdaemon.pl

	Start eventsdaemon (default settings):
		/opt/asterisk/scripts/events/eventsdaemon.pl &

	OR Start eventsdaemon (debug settings):

		/opt/asterisk/scripts/events/eventsdaemon.pl debug 

	At some point it may be desirable to delete unwanted events from the database
	table. The eventsdaemon is also designed for this.
	please check eventsdaemon.pl for parameter "log_life"


7) set upload folder access to 777

	chmod 777 /var/www/html/astercrm/upload

8) Testing: browse to http://localhost/astercrm

	or http://YOUR-WEB-SERVER-ADDRESS/astercrm
		
	login with admin/admin

3. How to use confirm button

	Customer field support auto-complete, which means it will list all items in 
	customer database matched with your entered. if you find the customer  already exsited, 
	select the item and then click "confirm" button, then all information for the customer 
	will be filled automaticly. (screenshot/1,2,3) Click "Cancel" button will clear all 
	information, you can enter another customer .

	Contact field is almost same with customer field, but it only list contacts belongs 
	to the customer above.

Manager Interface 

1. Import
2. Export
3. Statisic
4. Extension

Binding astercrm account and asterisk extension here, 
also manager could grant privileges to astercrm account.

username:		username to log into astercrm
password:		password to log into astercrm
usertype:		only two levels for now. 
				If it's "admin" in this field, 
				which means this account could enter manager interface section.
extension:		a extension would be binding to this user,
				which means all events of the extension would reflect this user
				such as dial, hangup, also pop-up
				digits only 
				(e.g. 8000)
extensions:		which extensions the user could see status, and use click to transfer
				put several extensions here, use comma to seperate
				(e.g. 8000,8001,8002,8003)
5. Customer

6. Predictive Dialer

Administrator could upload a phone list to table "diallist", so that astercrm know 
which number could be dialed.
there's are two field in table "diallist"
	phonenumber and assign
About assign, it would be a extension number in this field, means this number could be dialed by which extension, 
this phone number would appears in "agent dial mode"

there're two mode in dialer setion:

	a. agent dial mode

if phone number is assigned to extension in table "dial list", when agent login, 
he could see a button "get a new number" and XX records in dial list, 
then he can dial the button, a new table would pop up,
and in this table would have a phone number, agent could click the number to make a call. 
once agent click the button and a new table pop up with a new phone number, 
the number would be
deleted from database, so agent could see that the number in dial list would decrease, 
until no records in database, and the button disappears.

	b. manager predial mode

manager dial mode need a "admim" user, in predictive dialer module, 
if there're records in table "diallist"
(whatever assigned or not), he could see XXX records (means records number in database), 
a "Dial" button and a inputbox (means maximum concurrent active channel in asterisk, 
it would "pause" when asterisk active channels reach this number untill some channels 
hang up dialer would "continue" automaticly), during
this progress manger could stop/start the dialer or change max channels number. 
In config.php you could set where the call would be sent to when answered, 
such as a IVR, a queue or whatever you need.

7. System 

7.1
	You could see sip peer status here, 
	such as which peer is calling, 
		    which peer is online or offline

	Notice:
		some peer may not appear here, because system monitor read data from database
		so usually we can not read all sip peer status here

7.2 you coudl see the result of cli command:
		sip show channels verbose
	this result refresh every one second.
