1) Download and unzip the source

	cd /var/www/html
	unzip astercc-0.03.zip
	mv astercc-0.0.03 astercc

2) Create the directories and move astercc daemon scripts:

	mkdir -p /opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/
	mv /var/www/html/astercc/daemons/* /opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/
	chmod +x /opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/astercc
	chmod +x /opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/asterrc

3) Create the MySQL database and table, asterCC need mysql 4.1 or above

	mysqladmin -uyourmysqluser -pyourmysqlpasswd create astercc
	mysql -uyourmysqluser -pyourmysqlpasswd astercc </var/www/html/astercc/sql/astercc.sql 

	Note: here we create the database named astercc, you could use whatever db name you want
				use your configration to replace "yourmysqluser" and "yourmysqlpasswd"

4) Update /etc/asterisk/manager.conf to enable Manager connections
	Note: asterisk and astercc could be on different server
 
	Add something like this to the manager.conf file:

	[general]
	enabled = yes
	port = 5038
	bindaddr = 0.0.0.0
	;displayconnects = yes

	;the following line could be changed by yourself
	[eventsdaemon]
	secret = myeventsdaemon
	read = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user
	write = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user
	deny=0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
	; only allow local access, if you want to run astercrm on another server
	; use your astercrm ip to replace 127.0.0.1 or add a new line
	permit=127.0.0.1/255.255.255.0	 

5) modify /var/www/html/astercc/astercc.conf.php and /opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/astercc.conf to fit your configration
		mainly database setting and AMI setting

6) Start astercc daemons

	/opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/astercc -d
	/opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/asterrc -d

7) set folder access 

	chmod 777 /var/www/html/astercc/upload

8) Testing: browse to http://localhost/astercc

	or http://YOUR-WEB-SERVER-ADDRESS/astercc
		
	login with admin/admin

9) set your first booth

1. go "Reseller" and add a reseller
2. go "Group" add a group belong to the reseller
3. go "Clid" add some clid for this group, then the account in asterisk with the clid would be billing as a user in this group
4. go "Account" add a account, usertype could be "groupadmin" and belongs to the group you just added
5. go "Rate to Customer" and add some rate for the group, if you dont select reseller or group, the rate could be the default rate all all resellers/groups
6. login as groupadmin account, then you should see some box as the attachments.
7. try make a call using the ip phone with the clid, you could see the calling and billing message in the box
