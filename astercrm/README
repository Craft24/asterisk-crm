====================================================================================

asterCRM is a AJAX based 'Call Center' system. 

First, Asterisk Events are captured as the occur via a perl script called eventsdaemon and
logged to a MySQl database table.
Since Asterisk is sending these events as they occur (and not being polled for these events),
this leads to a more efficient Asterisk interface.

eventsdaemon.pl is a perl script which connects to AMI (the Asterisk Manager
Interface) via a stock, listens for any events or messages coming from
the AMI, time stamps each event and logs them to a MySQL database table.

eventsdaemon can be run on any machine and not confined running in your Asterisk server,
More information on the function of eventsdaemon can be found in its source comments.

WEB PHP scripts will analyze Asterisk Events in database, and finish call center jobs, 
such as pop-up, click to dial, call queue ... 

asterCRM scripts require a running WEB and MySQL server (in which stored asterisk events).
All of these processes can run on the same server, 
however, multiple servers enhance performance.

2. asterCRM Installation: (assuming your WEB root is /var/www/html)

1) Download and unzip the source

	cd /var/www/html
	unzip astercc-X.X.zip
	mv astercc-X.X astercc
	
	/var/www/html/astercc/astercrm				main directory and PHP scripts of astercrm
	/var/www/html/astercc/astercrm/astercrm.conf.php	astercrm configration file
	/var/www/html/astercc/astercrm/includes 		files needed in php scripts
	/var/www/html/astercc/astercrm/includes/language	asterCRM language files
	/var/www/html/astercc/astercrm/skin			image/style files used by astercrm
	/var/www/html/astercc/astercrm/js								auto-complete java scripts
	/var/www/html/astercc/astercrm/upload			upload folder, make sure it get write permission
	/var/www/html/astercc/sql				sql to create database tables 
	/var/www/html/astercc/script 				astercc daemon and some script files 

	It is highly advised that the whole eventsdaemon directory be moved to a more secure
	location like /opt and out of the WEB root directory (in step 2)

2) Create the directories and move eventsdaemon scripts:

	mkdir -p /opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc 
	mv /var/www/html/astercc/script/* /opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc
	chmod +x /opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/eventsdaemon.pl
	chmod +x /opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/eventdog.sh
	chmod +x /opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/astercc
	chmod +x /opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/astercctools
	chmod +x /opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/dialer.pl
	chmod +x /opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/cdr_move.pl
	chmod +x /opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/asterrc
	chmod +x /opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/astercclock
	chmod +x /opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/asterccdaemon
	chmod +x /opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/asterccd

3) Create the MySQL database and table, asterCRM need mysql 4.1 or above

	mysqladmin -uyourmysqluser -pyourmysqlpasswd create astercc
	mysql -uyourmysqluser -pyourmysqlpasswd astercc < /var/www/html/astercc/sql/astercc.sql 

	Note: here we create the database named astercc, it both used for astercrm and asterbilling,
	you could use whatever db name you want	use your configration to replace "yourmysqluser"
	and "yourmysqlpasswd"
	
4) Update /etc/asterisk/manager.conf to enable Manager connections
	Note:allow asterisk and astercrm on different server
 
	Add something like this to the manager.conf file:

	[general]
	enabled = yes
	port = 5038
	bindaddr = 0.0.0.0
	;displayconnects = yes

	;the following line could be changed by yourself
	[astercc]
	secret = astercc
	read = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user
	write = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user
	deny=0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
	; only allow local access, if you want to run astercrm on another server
	; use your astercrm ip to replace 127.0.0.1 or add a new line
	permit=127.0.0.1/255.255.255.0	 
	
5) modify astercrm.conf.php to fit your configuration
	mainly database setting and AMI setting, the other parameters could be set in astercrm page


6) Start Asterisk and  daemon
	There are two daemon modes you can choose, eventsdaemon mode or astercc mode
	
	A for astercc mode

	try start astercc:		
		modify /opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/astercc.conf to fit your configuration
		mainly database setting and AMI setting.
		/opt/asterisk/scripts/eventsdaemon/astercc
	if you could read like following line:
		"Connecting to mysql database on 127.0.0.1:
		 Database connection successful.
		 Connecting to asterisk on 210.83.203.100 port 7998:
		 Asterisk socket connection successful.
		 Check asterisk username & secret:
		 Success
		 Monitor Start: 
		 ...(some log message)..."
	congratulations, your astercc works well, use 'ctrl + c' to exit
	or else, please check your database/AMI configration in astercc.conf

	Start up astercc (default settings):
		modify /var/www/html/astercrm/astercrm.conf.php set eventtype to curcdr
		/opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/astercc -d

	Start up astercc daemons when system startup:
	Note: This option can only fit to redhat-release system. 
	If you want astercc daemons to start automatically when you boot your
	machine, you need to :

	cp /opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/asterccd /etc/rc.d/init.d
	chmod 755 /etc/rc.d/init.d/asterccd
	chkconfig --add asterccd
	
	Advice: Configure your astercc restart once everyday, it's not necessary, but it 's good for your astercc operation.
	for example: you want to restart astercc at 0'clock everyday,just do the following line as root. 
	crontab -e
	add a line: 
		0 0 * * * /etc/rc.d/init.d/asterccd restart 
	end of this file, the first "0" figures minutes and the second "0" figures hours.

	B for eventsdaemon mode
	try start eventsdaemon:
		modify eventsdaemon.pl to fit your configuration mainly database setting and AMI setting.
		/opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/eventsdaemon.pl 	
	if you could read:

		"Message: Authentication accepted"

	congratulations, your eventsdaemon works well
	use ctrl + c to exit
	or else, please check your database/AMI configration in eventsdaemon.pl

	Start eventsdaemon (default settings):
		modify astercrm.conf set eventtype to event
		/opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/eventsdaemon.pl -d

	At some point it may be desirable to delete unwanted events from the database
	table. The eventsdaemon is also designed for this.
	please check eventsdaemon.pl for parameter "log_life"

	also we provide a "watch dog", it would help you restart eventsdaemon when it shutdown
	add this shell to your start-up file
		/opt/asterisk/scripts/astercc/eventdog.sh
	so that everytime your server start, eventsdaemon would be loaded


7) set file&folder access 

	chmod 777 /var/www/html/astercc/astercrm/upload
	chmod 777 /var/www/html/astercc/astercrm/astercrm.conf.php

	if asterisk and astercrm running in one server,you could make a soft link to astercrm web dir for listen monitor records. 
	ln -s /var/spool/asterisk/monitor/ /vavr/www/html/astercc/astercrm/monitor
	note: astercrm support listen monitors online only can be wav format file. 
8) Testing: browse to http://localhost/astercc/astercrm 

	or http://YOUR-WEB-SERVER-ADDRESS/astercc/astercrm

	also you can move astercrm dir to any path where your apache be allowed to access.
		
	login with admin/admin

Manager Interface 

1. Import
2. Export
3. Statisic
4. Extension

Binding astercrm account and asterisk extension here, 
also manager could grant privileges to astercrm account.

username:		username to log into astercrm
password:		password to log into astercrm
usertype:		only two levels for now. 
				If it's "admin" in this field, 
				which means this account could enter manager interface section.
extension:		a extension would be binding to this user,
				which means all events of the extension would reflect this user
				such as dial, hangup, also pop-up
				digits only 
				(e.g. 8000)
extensions:		which extensions the user could see status, and use click to transfer
				put several extensions here, use comma to seperate
				(e.g. 8000,8001,8002,8003)
5. Customer

6. Predictive Dialer

Administrator could upload a phone list to table "diallist", so that astercrm know 
which number could be dialed.
there's are two field in table "diallist"
	phonenumber and assign
About assign, it would be a extension number in this field, means this number could be dialed by which extension, 
this phone number would appears in "agent dial mode"

there're two mode in dialer setion:

	a. agent dial mode

if phone number is assigned to extension in table "dial list", when agent login, 
he could see a button "get a new number" and XX records in dial list, 
then he can dial the button, a new table would pop up,
and in this table would have a phone number, agent could click the number to make a call. 
once agent click the button and a new table pop up with a new phone number, 
the number would be
deleted from database, so agent could see that the number in dial list would decrease, 
until no records in database, and the button disappears.

	b. manager predial mode

manager dial mode need a "admim" user, in predictive dialer module, 
if there're records in table "diallist"
(whatever assigned or not), he could see XXX records (means records number in database), 
a "Dial" button and a inputbox (means maximum concurrent active channel in asterisk, 
it would "pause" when asterisk active channels reach this number untill some channels 
hang up dialer would "continue" automaticly), during
this progress manger could stop/start the dialer or change max channels number. 
In config.php you could set where the call would be sent to when answered, 
such as a IVR, a queue or whatever you need.

7. System 

7.1
	You could see sip peer status here, 
	such as which peer is calling, 
		    which peer is online or offline

	Notice:
		some peer may not appear here, because system monitor read data from database
		so usually we can not read all sip peer status here

7.2 you coudl see the result of cli command:
		sip show channels verbose
	this result refresh every one second.



8. Survey
